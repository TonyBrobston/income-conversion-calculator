# 💸 Income Conversion Calculator
### W2 to 1099 Made Simple

This converter solves the "apples-to-oranges" comparison problem by revealing the hidden costs, such as payroll taxes and healthcare premiums, that an employer typically covers for a W-2 employee. By calculating a 1099 rate that accounts for these missing benefits and unpaid time off, it ensures contractors price their services high enough to maintain their actual standard of living.
